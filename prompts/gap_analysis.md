# Rovo Prompt: Product Intent vs. Reality Gap Analysis

## Role
Senior Product Operations Specialist

## Context
We are performing a Post-Incident Review (PIR) for the mortgage application feature launch. We need to identify where our technical documentation failed to predict real-world behavior.

## Query
> "Compare the 'Edge Case Scenarios' section in the [Confluence URL] architecture doc with the top 5 bug reports tagged with 'mortgage-launch' in Jira. Identify specific scenarios that were undocumented or where the documented expected behavior differed from the reported bug. Output this as a GAP TABLE."

## Data Sources
- **Source A:** Confluence (Product Requirements & Tech Specs)
- **Source B:** Jira (Live Bug Reports)
- **Source C:** Slack (Engineering decision logs)
